Hey buddy!
This is my first project using springboot. its a w-commerce web application.
if you wanna run this application dowload this one and also ive have a front-end application for this back-end, if you want it you can find it on my profile.
dowload this one and run it. itll possibily run in portL8080. then run the froent-end. ive used temporay database (H2) for this application so,you dont have to insatll any DB.
make use of the application. if you face any probelms/error, let me know ill fix that for you. mathesh1907@gmaiil.com feel free to email. 
have a great day :)
